## Style Guidelines

### Bash Scripting Standards

- **Use `#!/bin/bash`** as shebang
- **4-space indentation** (no tabs)
- **Descriptive variable names** in lowercase with underscores
- **Function names** in lowercase with underscores
- **Comments** for complex logic and functions
- **Error handling** with proper exit codes
- **Quoting** variables to prevent word splitting

### Example Code Style

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration variables
RETRY_DELAY=30
MAX_RETRIES=3

# Function to check service status
check_service_status() {
    local service_name="$1"
    local check_command="$2"
    
    if eval "$check_command"; then
        log_message "Service $service_name is running"
        return 0
    else
        log_message "Service $service_name is not running"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

### Documentation Standards

- **Clear headings** with proper hierarchy
- **Code examples** with syntax highlighting
- **Step-by-step instructions** for complex procedures
- **Cross-references** to related sections
- **Screenshots** where helpful

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting changes:

1. **Test on Raspberry Pi** with Pi-hole installed
2. **Verify all monitoring functions** work correctly
3. **Test maintenance mode** functionality
4. **Check email notifications** are sent properly
5. **Validate log file** entries are correct

### Test Scenarios

- **Normal operation** - All services running
- **Service failures** - Pi-hole FTL down, Unbound down
- **System stress** - High CPU, memory, temperature
- **Network issues** - DNS resolution failures
- **Maintenance mode** - Alerts properly suppressed

### Automated Testing

We welcome contributions for:

- **Unit tests** for individual functions
- **Integration tests** for full system testing
- **Performance tests** for resource usage
- **Validation scripts** for configuration

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code improvements

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add retry logic for DNS resolution checks

- Implement 3-retry mechanism for DNS queries
- Add configurable delay between retries
- Update documentation with new configuration options
```

### Code Review Process

1. **All changes** require review before merging
2. **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
3. **Maintain discussion** in pull request comments
4. **Squash commits** if requested before merging
